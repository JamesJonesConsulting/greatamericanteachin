                <p>My name is <strong>James Jones</strong> and my daughter is a student in Ms Maker's 1st Grade class.</p>
                <p>I bet a lot of you use computers. Maybe you're practicing with reading, writing and perhaps math too!</p>
                <p><i>Maybe</i> even some of you are playing computer games too! .... maybe a bit more than your parents like ;-)</p>

                <p>Games and technology can be fun. Have any of you ever wondered where it comes from?</p>
                <p>People create it. I'll bet a lot of you create your own art and write your own stories.</p>
                <p>I create whats called "software". It's a mixture of writing and creativity mixed with problem solving and some good math skills.</p>
                <p>I'm going to show you all something I put together and I'll take suggestions and change it throughout the day.</p>
                <p>In fact, you can get a copy of it to and play with it at: <a href="https://github.com/jamjon3/greatamericanteachin" target=”_blank”>https://github.com/jamjon3/greatamericanteachin</a></p>
                <p>BTW: What is that? That's what's called "source control". It allows people to share what they write and share changes. We know how important working together is and this is one great way to do that!</p>
